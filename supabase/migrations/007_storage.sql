-- Migration 007: Private Resume Storage Bucket & Security Policies
-- Establishes the private 'resumes' bucket and restricts object access to auth.uid()

-- 1. Create Private Storage Bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'resumes',
  'resumes',
  false,
  5242880, -- 5 MB in bytes
  ARRAY[
    'application/pdf',
    'application/msword',
    'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document'
  ]
)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET
  public = false,
  file_size_limit = 5242880,
  allowed_mime_types = ARRAY[
    'application/pdf',
    'application/msword',
    'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document'
  ];

-- 2. Storage RLS Policies
-- Allow candidates to view only their own resume files (folder matches auth.uid())
CREATE POLICY "Users can read own resume files"
  ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    bucket_id = 'resumes'
    AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
  );

-- Allow candidates to upload only into their own folder (resumes/{auth.uid()}/*)
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own resume files"
  ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'resumes'
    AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
  );

-- Allow candidates to update their own resume files
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own resume files"
  ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    bucket_id = 'resumes'
    AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'resumes'
    AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
  );

-- Allow candidates to delete their own resume files
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own resume files"
  ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    bucket_id = 'resumes'
    AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
  );
